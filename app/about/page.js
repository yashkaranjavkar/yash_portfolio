              Student of Masters in Interaction Design at IDC School of Design,
              IIT Bombay. It has been a roller coaster ride to shift my
              discipline from learning mechanical engineering to now getting
              into interaction design. I have used my engineering logic and
              designer imagination in executing diverse projects while doing my
              Masters at IDC.
